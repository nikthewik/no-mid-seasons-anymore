      "The increase in Earth's temperature is a clear indicator of climate change, with global average temperatures rising by about 1.4Â°C compared to pre-industrial levels. This warming, primarily caused by the rise in greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, leads to severe impacts such as more frequent and intense heatwaves, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems and agriculture.",

  {
    id: "methane",
    caption:
      "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, over 25 times more effective than CO2 at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Its levels have significantly increased due to human activities such as agriculture and fossil fuel extraction. This rise in methane contributes to global warming, exacerbating issues like extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and negative impacts on human health and food security.",
  },
  {
    id: "arctic",
    caption:
      "The arctic is experiencing rapid warming, with temperatures rising at twice the global average rate. This accelerated warming leads to the melting of sea ice and permafrost, contributing to rising sea levels and altering global weather patterns. The loss of ice also threatens local wildlife and indigenous communities, disrupting their traditional ways of life and habitats.",
  },
  {
    id: "co2",
    caption:
      "CO2 levels have surged due to the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial activities. This increase in carbon dioxide is the primary driver of global warming, leading to higher global temperatures. Elevated CO2 levels contribute to ocean acidification, harm marine life, and exacerbate climate-related issues such as extreme weather events and disrupted ecosystems.",
  },
  {
    id: "no2",
    caption:
      "NO2, or nitrogen dioxide, is a significant greenhouse gas produced mainly by vehicle emissions and industrial processes. Its increasing levels contribute to global warming and air pollution, leading to health problems like respiratory issues. Additionally, NO2 exacerbates climate change by contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, which further harms ecosystems and human health.",
